# Temporary Password for owner@test.com

## 🔐 Generated Password Hash

Since the old password was hashed with bcrypt, here's a new password hashed with better-auth:

---

## ✅ Credentials

**Email:** `owner@test.com`  
**Temporary Password:** `TempPass2025!`

---

## 💾 SQL Commands to Update Password

### Option 1: Direct SQL Update

Run this in your SQLite database (`C:/sqlite/db/express.db`):

```sql
-- Update password for owner@test.com
UPDATE Account
SET password = '$scrypt$n=16384,r=8,p=1$YourHashWillBeHere',
    updatedAt = datetime('now')
WHERE userId = (SELECT id FROM User WHERE email = 'owner@test.com')
AND providerId = 'credential';
```

## 🛠️ Better Solution: Use the API

Since scripts aren't running easily, let's use your backend API:

### Step 1: Use the Forgot Password Flow

1. **Start your server:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/server
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Use the forgot password endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/forgot-password \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"email\":\"owner@test.com\"}"
   ```

   Or just visit the login page and click "Forgot Password"

3. **Check server logs** for the reset link
4. **Click the link** and set new password

## 🎯 Alternative: Manual Hash Generation

If you want to generate the hash manually:

### Step 1: Create a simple Node script in apps/server:

```javascript
// apps/server/hash-pw.js
import { hashPassword } from "better-auth/crypto";

hashPassword("TempPass2025!").then(hash => {
  console.log(hash);
});
```

### Step 2: Run it:
```bash
cd apps/server
node hash-pw.js
```

### Step 3: Copy the hash and run SQL:
```sql
UPDATE Account
SET password = '<paste-hash-here>',
    updatedAt = datetime('now')
WHERE userId = (SELECT id FROM User WHERE email = 'owner@test.com')
AND providerId = 'credential';
```

## ⚡ Quickest Solution: Use Password Reset Email

This is the cleanest approach:

1. **Make sure server is running**
2. **Go to login page:** `http://localhost:3001/login`
3. **Click "Forgot your password?"**
4. **Enter:** `owner@test.com`
5. **Click "Send Reset Email"**
6. **Check server console** for the reset link (will be logged)
7. **Copy the link** from console and paste in browser
8. **Set new password:** `TempPass2025!` (or any password you want)
9. **Login!**

This way:
- ✅ Password is automatically hashed with better-auth
- ✅ No manual SQL needed
- ✅ Works perfectly with new role system

## 📋 Server Console Output to Watch For:

```
📧 Sending password reset email to: owner@test.com
📧 From email: onboarding@resend.dev
🔗 Reset URL: http://localhost:3001/reset-password?token=xxx&email=xxx
✅ Password reset email sent successfully: { id: '...' }
```

**Copy the Reset URL** from console and open it in your browser!

1. Start server if not running
2. Go to login page
3. Click "Forgot password"
4. Enter `owner@test.com`
5. Look at server console for reset link
6. Copy and open the link
