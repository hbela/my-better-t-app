# Provider First Login - Mandatory Password Change Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a mandatory password change dialog for providers on their first login, along with correct redirect to the provider dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend: `apps/web/src/components/sign-in-form.tsx`

#### Added State Variables
- `showPasswordChangeDialog`: Controls dialog visibility
- `newPassword` & `confirmPassword`: Password input fields
- `isChangingPassword`: Loading state during password update
- `pendingRedirectRole`: Stores user role for redirect after password change

#### Added Password Change Check
After successful login:
```typescript
// Check if user needs to change password
const response = await fetch(
  `${import.meta.env.VITE_SERVER_URL}/api/auth/check-password-change`,
  { credentials: "include" }
);

if (response.ok) {
  const data = await response.json();
  if (data.needsPasswordChange) {
    // Show password change dialog
    setPendingRedirectRole(role);
    setShowPasswordChangeDialog(true);
    return; // Don't redirect yet
  }
}
```

#### Added Password Change Handler
```typescript
const handlePasswordChange = async () => {
  // Validates password (min 8 chars, passwords match)
  // Calls /api/auth/update-password
  // Redirects to appropriate dashboard after success
}
```

#### Added Mandatory Dialog UI
- Non-dismissible dialog (prevents closing by clicking outside or Esc)
- Two password fields with validation
- Shows user they must change password before continuing
- Redirects to correct dashboard after password change

### 2. Backend: Already Configured

The server (`apps/server/src/index.ts`) already has all necessary endpoints:

#### Provider Creation Endpoint (lines 908-1036)
```typescript
// Sets needsPasswordChange flag when owner creates provider
needsPasswordChange: true

// Uses temporary password
const tempPassword = "password123";
```

#### Check Password Change Endpoint (lines 2643-2666)
```typescript
GET /api/auth/check-password-change
// Returns { needsPasswordChange: boolean, user: {...} }
```

#### Update Password Endpoint (lines 2668-2718)
```typescript
POST /api/auth/update-password
// Updates password and clears needsPasswordChange flag
```

### 3. Redirect Logic

Already correct in both files:
- Sign-in: Line 84 → `navigate({ to: "/provider/" })`
- Sign-up: Line 47 → `navigate({ to: "/provider/" })`

## How It Works

1. **Owner creates provider:**
   - Owner uses provider creation form
   - Provider account created with:
     - Email: (provided)
     - Password: "password123" (temporary)
     - Role: PROVIDER
     - `needsPasswordChange: true`

2. **Provider first login:**
   - Provider enters email and temporary password
   - Login succeeds
   - System checks `needsPasswordChange` flag
   - If true: Shows mandatory password change dialog
   - Dialog cannot be dismissed (must change password)

3. **Password change:**
   - Provider enters new password (min 8 chars)
   - Confirms password
   - Clicks "Update Password"
   - Password updated in database
   - `needsPasswordChange` flag cleared
   - **Automatically redirected to http://localhost:3001/provider**

4. **Subsequent logins:**
   - `needsPasswordChange` is false
   - Provider directly redirected to `/provider/` dashboard
   - No password change dialog shown

## Testing Steps

1. **As Owner:**
   - Login to http://localhost:3001
   - Navigate to provider management
   - Create a new provider with email and name
   - Note the temporary password: "password123"

2. **As New Provider:**
   - Logout or open incognito window
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/login
   - Login with provider email and password "password123"
   - **Expected:** Mandatory password change dialog appears
   - Enter new password (at least 8 characters)
   - Confirm password
   - Click "Update Password"
   - **Expected:** Redirected to http://localhost:3001/provider

3. **Verify Redirect:**
   - Check URL is http://localhost:3001/provider (or http://localhost:3001/provider/)
   - Check provider dashboard loads correctly
   - Check header shows correct email and role "PROVIDER"

4. **Subsequent Login:**
   - Logout
   - Login again with new password
   - **Expected:** Direct redirect to provider dashboard (no password dialog)

## Security Features

- Password change is **mandatory** and cannot be skipped
- Dialog cannot be closed until password is changed
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Password confirmation required
- Temporary password "password123" forces immediate change
- `needsPasswordChange` flag automatically cleared after change

## Files Modified

- `apps/web/src/components/sign-in-form.tsx` - Added password change logic and dialog

## Files Already Configured (No Changes Needed)

- `apps/server/src/index.ts` - Backend endpoints and provider creation
- `apps/web/src/components/sign-up-form.tsx` - Redirect logic already correct
- `apps/web/src/routes/provider/index.tsx` - Provider dashboard route

## Notes

- The redirect to `/provider/` was already correct in the code
- The backend already had full support for password change
- Only needed to add the frontend dialog and check logic
- Works for all roles (ADMIN, OWNER, PROVIDER, CLIENT) if they have `needsPasswordChange: true`
