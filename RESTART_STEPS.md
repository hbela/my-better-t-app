# 🔴 CRITICAL: Server NOT Restarted

## The Issue

Your console shows:
- `🔍 User role: undefined` ❌
- `🔍 Needs password change: undefined` ❌
- `404 on /api/auth/check-password-change` ❌

This means **the server code changes haven't been applied yet**.

## 🚨 STOP and Follow These Steps EXACTLY:

### Step 1: Check Database First

Before restarting, let's verify the database has correct data.

Open your SQLite database and run:

```sql
SELECT email, role, needsPasswordChange, emailVerified
FROM user 
WHERE email = 'anna.kovacs@tanarock.hu';
```

**Expected:**
```
email: anna.kovacs@tanarock.hu
role: PROVIDER
needsPasswordChange: 1 (or true)
emailVerified: 1 (or true)
```

**If role is NOT "PROVIDER" or needsPasswordChange is NOT 1:**

```sql
UPDATE user 
SET role = 'PROVIDER', needsPasswordChange = 1
WHERE email = 'anna.kovacs@tanarock.hu';

-- Verify the update:
SELECT email, role, needsPasswordChange FROM user WHERE email = 'anna.kovacs@tanarock.hu';
```

### Step 2: Find Your Running Processes

You need to **COMPLETELY STOP** both server and client before restarting.

#### On Windows:

**Option A - Find in Task Manager:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`
2. Find processes named `node.exe` or `node`
3. Look for ones running your app
4. End them

**Option B - Find in PowerShell:**
```powershell
# See all node processes
Get-Process node

# Kill all node processes (CAREFUL - this kills ALL node processes)
Stop-Process -Name node -Force
```

**Option C - In your terminals:**
1. Go to each terminal running the server/client
2. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop
3. If it doesn't stop, press `Ctrl + C` multiple times
4. Close the terminal window if needed

### Step 3: Restart Server (Terminal 1)

```bash
# Navigate to server
cd apps/server

# Start server
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

**Wait for this log:**
```
🚀 Server is running on port 3000
```

**Also look for these NEW logs we added:**
```
🔐 Auth Package - DATABASE_URL: ...
🔐 Auth Package - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET: Set
🔐 Auth Package - BETTER_AUTH_URL: ...
```

### Step 4: Restart Client (Terminal 2)

```bash
# Navigate to web
cd apps/web

# Start client
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

**Wait for:**
```
Local: http://localhost:3001/
```

### Step 5: Clear Everything in Browser

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or use **Incognito/Private window** (easiest!)

### Step 6: Login and Check BOTH Consoles

#### In SERVER Terminal, you should now see:

When you login:
```
🔐 Auth Request: POST /api/auth/sign-in/email {...}
🔐 Auth Response Status: 200
🔍 User read from database: { 
  email: 'anna.kovacs@tanarock.hu', 
  role: 'PROVIDER', 
  needsPasswordChange: true 
}
🔐 Session created for user: anna.kovacs@tanarock.hu
🔐 Session user data: { 
  role: 'PROVIDER', 
  needsPasswordChange: true 
}
```

#### In BROWSER Console, you should now see:

```
🔍 Sign-in context: {...}
🔍 User data: { 
  email: "anna.kovacs@tanarock.hu",
  role: "PROVIDER",           <-- Should NOT be undefined!
  needsPasswordChange: true   <-- Should NOT be undefined!
  ...
}
🔍 User role: PROVIDER
🔍 Needs password change: true
✅ Password change required - showing dialog
```

### Step 7: What You Should See

**If restarted correctly:**
1. ✅ No 404 error on `/api/auth/check-password-change`
2. ✅ `role: "PROVIDER"` (not undefined)
3. ✅ `needsPasswordChange: true` (not undefined)
4. ✅ Password change dialog appears
5. ✅ After password change → redirects to `/provider`

**If you STILL see undefined:**

Share these with me:
1. The SQL query result from Step 1
2. The SERVER terminal output after restart
3. The BROWSER console output

## 🎯 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Stopped ALL node processes (Ctrl+C in both terminals)
- [ ] Checked database - role is 'PROVIDER'
- [ ] Checked database - needsPasswordChange is 1
- [ ] Restarted server (apps/server)
- [ ] Saw "🚀 Server is running on port 3000" in terminal
- [ ] Restarted client (apps/web)  
- [ ] Saw "Local: http://localhost:3001/" in terminal
- [ ] Cleared browser cache OR using incognito
- [ ] Logged in again
- [ ] Checked BOTH server and browser consoles for debug logs

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Not fully stopping the processes** - Ctrl+C once isn't enough sometimes
2. **Not waiting for server to fully start** - Wait for the "🚀 Server is running" message
3. **Old browser cache** - Use incognito or clear cache properly
4. **Looking at old terminal** - Make sure you're looking at the NEW server logs after restart
5. **Database not updated** - Role must be 'PROVIDER' in database

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If after following ALL steps above you still see undefined, it means there's a deeper issue with Better Auth configuration. 

**Share with me:**
```
1. Database query result (from Step 1)
2. Server terminal output (after restart, when you login)
3. Browser console output (when you login)
4. What port is your server actually running on?
```

The debug logs will tell us EXACTLY what's wrong! 🔍
