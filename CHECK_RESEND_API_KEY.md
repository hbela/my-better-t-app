# ⚠️ RESEND_API_KEY NOT SET

## 🚨 Critical Issue Found

Your server logs show emails being "sent successfully" BUT:
- ❌ `RESEND_API_KEY` is **NOT SET** in environment
- ❌ `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is **undefined**
- ❌ No emails in Resend dashboard
- ❌ No emails in inbox/spam

**What's happening:**
- Resend client is initialized with `undefined` API key
- It's returning fake "success" responses
- No emails are actually being sent

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Add API Key to .env

### Step 1: Check if .env File Exists

```bash
cd apps/server
ls .env
# or
dir .env
```

**If file doesn't exist:**
```bash
# Create it
New-Item .env -ItemType File
```

### Step 2: Add Resend Configuration

Edit `apps/server/.env` and add:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=file:C:/sqlite/db/express.db

# Server
PORT=3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Resend Email Service - REQUIRED!
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Find your API key OR create a new one
3. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)
4. Paste it in the `.env` file

### Step 4: Restart Server

```bash
cd apps/server
pnpm dev
```

### Step 5: Verify Environment Loaded

Check server startup logs for:
```
📧 Email service: Configured
```

NOT:
```
📧 Email service: Not configured
```

## 🧪 Test After Adding API Key

### Test 1: Check env vars loaded

Watch for this in server startup:
```
🔍 DATABASE_URL: file:C:/sqlite/db/express.db
📧 Email service: Configured  ← Should say "Configured" not "Not configured"
```

### Test 2: Trigger password reset

1. Request password reset
2. Check server logs for:
   ```
   📧 Sending password reset email to: user@example.com
   📧 From email: onboarding@resend.dev
   ✅ Password reset email sent successfully: { data: { id: '...' }, error: null }
   ```

### Test 3: Check Resend Dashboard

1. Go to https://resend.com/emails
2. You should NOW see the email listed
3. Click on it to see delivery status

---

## 🔍 Why Emails Weren't Showing in Resend

**When API key is not set:**
- Resend client creates with `new Resend(undefined)`
- Client might return mock responses
- No actual API calls made
- Dashboard shows nothing
- No emails sent

**When API key IS set:**
- Resend makes real API calls
- Emails appear in dashboard
- Emails get delivered
- Everything works

---

## 📋 Current .env Should Have:

```env
DATABASE_URL=file:C:/sqlite/db/express.db
PORT=3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

# CRITICAL - Add these:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_YourActualKeyHere
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev

BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=some-random-secret-string
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **.env file location:** `apps/server/.env` (in server directory)
2. **API key format:** Must start with `re_`
3. **For testing:** Use `onboarding@resend.dev` as from email
4. **Restart required:** After editing .env

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Create/edit** `apps/server/.env`
2. **Add** RESEND_API_KEY (get from https://resend.com/api-keys)
3. **Add** RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
4. **Restart** server
5. **Test** password reset again
6. **Check** Resend dashboard - emails will now appear!

---

**Add the API key and restart - emails will start working!** 🚀
