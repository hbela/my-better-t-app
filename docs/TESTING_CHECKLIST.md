# Complete Testing Checklist - Subscription System

## ‚úÖ What's Working So Far

1. ‚úÖ Password changed using better-auth's scrypt
2. ‚úÖ Checkout creation with Polar Sandbox API
3. ‚úÖ Redirect to Polar checkout page
4. ‚úÖ Webhook receives and processes payment
5. ‚úÖ Dashboard updates after payment

## üß™ Complete Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Full Subscription Flow

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Login as organization owner
2. [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard`
3. [ ] Verify organization shows "Pending" status
4. [ ] Click "Subscribe Now"
5. [ ] Redirected to Polar sandbox checkout
6. [ ] Complete test payment on Polar
7. [ ] Redirected back to dashboard
8. [ ] Success toast appears
9. [ ] Dashboard shows "Active" status
10. [ ] Organization badge changes from Yellow to Green

**Expected Results:**
- Success toast: "üéâ Payment successful! Your organization is being activated..."
- Organization status: "Active" (green badge)
- Subscription badge: "active" (green)
- Quick stats updated: Active Subscriptions = 1

**Database Checks:**
```sql
-- Check organization enabled
SELECT enabled FROM organization WHERE id = '...';
-- Should be: true

-- Check subscription created
SELECT * FROM subscription WHERE organizationId = '...';
-- Should have: status = 'active'

-- Check payment recorded
SELECT * FROM payment ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT 1;
-- Should show: amount, status = 'succeeded'

-- Check product created
SELECT * FROM product;
-- Should show: Your Polar product
```

### Test 2: Subscription Details View

**Steps:**
1. [ ] On dashboard, find organization with active subscription
2. [ ] Click "View Details"
3. [ ] Expandable section opens
4. [ ] Verify "Subscription Details" section shows:
   - [ ] Status: active
   - [ ] Period Start date
   - [ ] Period End date
5. [ ] Verify "Recent Payments" section shows:
   - [ ] Payment amount ($10.00 or your price)
   - [ ] Payment date
   - [ ] Status badge: "succeeded"

**Expected Results:**

### Test 4: Multiple Organizations

**As Admin:**

### Test 5: Webhook Signature Verification

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Check server logs when webhook arrives
2. [ ] Look for: "‚úÖ Webhook signature verified"

2. [ ] Trigger webhook
3. [ ] Should see: "‚ùå Invalid webhook signature"
4. [ ] Organization should NOT be enabled

**Fix:**

2. [ ] Test again

### Test 6: API Endpoints

**Test My Subscriptions:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/subscriptions/my-subscriptions \
  -H "Cookie: better-auth.session_token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "sub_...",
    "status": "active",
    "product": {
      "name": "Monthly Subscription",
      "priceCents": 1000
    },
    "organization": {
      "name": "Test Hospital"
    },
    "payments": [...]
  }
]
```

**Test Organization Subscription:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/subscriptions/organization/ORG_ID \
  -H "Cookie: better-auth.session_token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

### Test 7: Edge Cases

**No Subscriptions:**
1. [ ] Login as new user (no organizations)
2. [ ] Dashboard shows empty state
3. [ ] Message: "You are not a member of any organizations yet."

**Expected:**
- No content flashing
- Smooth loading experience
- Skeletons match final layout

### Test 9: Success URL Redirect

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Complete payment on Polar
2. [ ] Verify redirect URL is correct:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/dashboard?subscribed=true&organizationId=...
   ```
3. [ ] Success toast appears immediately
4. [ ] URL cleaned up after 2 seconds
5. [ ] Data reloads showing updated status

**Expected:**
- Toast duration: 5 seconds
- URL cleaned to: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
- Organizations reload with new data

### Test 10: Error Handling

**Invalid Organization ID:**
```bash
POST /api/subscriptions/create-checkout
{
  "organizationId": "invalid-id"
}
```
**Expected:** 404 "Organization not found"

**Already Subscribed:**
1. [ ] Subscribe to organization
2. [ ] Try to subscribe again
3. [ ] Should get error: "Organization is already subscribed"

**Not Organization Owner:**
1. [ ] Login as member (not owner)
2. [ ] Try to call create-checkout API
3. [ ] Should get: 403 "Forbidden - Owner access required"

## üìä Database Verification

After completing a subscription, verify:

```sql
-- Products table
SELECT * FROM product;
-- Should have: Your Polar product with correct price

-- Subscriptions table
SELECT * FROM subscription;
-- Should have:
--   - polarCheckoutId
--   - polarSubscriptionId
--   - status = 'active'
--   - userId and organizationId linked

-- Payments table
SELECT * FROM payment;
-- Should have:
--   - amount in cents
--   - status = 'succeeded'
--   - subscriptionId linked

-- Organization enabled
SELECT enabled FROM organization WHERE id = '...';
-- Should be: true
```
