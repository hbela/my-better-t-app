# Medisched - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

We've successfully implemented a **complete multi-tenant healthcare scheduling platform** based on the PRD specifications. Here's what was delivered:

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Prisma)

### Models Implemented:

1. **User** - System users with authentication
   - Added `providers[]` and `bookings[]` relations
   
2. **Organization** - Tenants (hospitals)
   - Added `departments[]` relation
   
3. **Member** - Organization membership with roles (owner, provider, member)

4. **Department** ✨ NEW
   - Subdivision of organizations
   - Has many providers
   
5. **Provider** ✨ NEW
   - Links users to departments
   - Can create events
   - Unique constraint on `userId` + `departmentId`
   
6. **Event** ✨ NEW
   - Time slots created by providers
   - Tracks booking status
   - Includes title, description, start/end times
   
7. **Booking** ✨ NEW
   - Appointment confirmations
   - Links members to events
   - Triggers email notifications

### Key Features:
- ✅ Cascade deletes for data integrity
- ✅ Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
- ✅ Unique constraints to prevent duplicates
- ✅ Proper indexing for performance

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Better Auth Configuration:

1. **Organization Plugin**
   - Configured with 3 roles: `owner`, `provider`, `member`
   - Each role has specific permissions and descriptions
   
2. **Admin Plugin**
   - Global `ADMIN` role for platform oversight
   - Uses `systemRole` field

### Middleware Implemented:

1. **requireAuth** - Validates session and attaches user to request
2. **requireAdmin** - Checks for ADMIN system role
3. **requireOwner** - Validates organization ownership
4. **requireProvider** - Validates provider access to resources

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create `apps/server/.env`:

```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL="file:C:/sqlite/db/express.db"
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:5173"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="onboarding@yourdomain.com"
```

### 3. Generate Prisma Client

```bash
pnpm --filter @my-better-t-app/db db:generate
```

### 4. Push Database Schema

```bash
pnpm --filter @my-better-t-app/db exec prisma db push
```

### 5. Start the Server

```bash
pnpm --filter server dev
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🧪 Testing the API

### 1. Create an Admin User

Use Better Auth signup to create a user, then manually update in database:

```sql
UPDATE user SET systemRole = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

### 2. Create an Organization

Either:
- Use Polar webhook (production)
- Manually create via Better Auth organization plugin
- Use admin endpoint

### 3. Test the Flow

1. **Owner creates department:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/departments
   { "name": "Cardiology", "organizationId": "..." }
   ```

2. **Owner assigns provider:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/providers
   { "organizationId": "...", "departmentId": "...", "userId": "..." }
   ```

3. **Provider creates event:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/events
   { "providerId": "...", "title": "Consultation", "start": "...", "end": "..." }
   ```

4. **Member books event:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/bookings
   { "eventId": "..." }
   ```

5. **Check email** - Member receives confirmation!
