# Polar Checkout Flow Implementation

## Overview
The checkout flow allows organization owners to subscribe and activate their organizations through Polar payment processing.

## Flow Diagram

```
1. Admin creates organization (disabled by default)
   â†“
2. Owner sees "Pending Subscription" status on dashboard
   â†“
3. Owner clicks "Subscribe Now" button
   â†“
4. Frontend calls /api/subscriptions/create-checkout
   â†“
5. Backend creates Polar checkout session
   â†“
6. Backend returns checkoutUrl
   â†“
7. Frontend redirects user to Polar checkout page
   â†“
8. User completes payment on Polar
   â†“
9. Polar sends webhook to /api/webhooks/polar
   â†“
10. Backend enables organization (enabled: true)
   â†“
11. Organization is now active âœ…
```

## Frontend Implementation

### Admin Page (`/admin`)
- Lists all organizations with status badges (Active/Pending)
- Shows "Subscribe" button for organizations with `enabled: false`
- Button calls checkout API and redirects to Polar

```tsx
const handleSubscribe = async (orgId: string, orgName: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${import.meta.env.VITE_SERVER_URL}/api/subscriptions/create-checkout`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      credentials: "include",
      body: JSON.stringify({ organizationId: orgId }),
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  window.location.href = data.checkoutUrl; // Redirect to Polar
};
```

### Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
- Shows user's organizations with subscription status
- Displays "Subscribe Now" button for owners of unpaid organizations
- Uses same checkout flow as admin page

## Backend Endpoints

### 1. Create Checkout Session
**POST** `/api/subscriptions/create-checkout`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "organizationId": "9c91d5a8-6dac-49ec-b488-6f803a81ae38"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "checkoutUrl": "https://polar.sh/checkout?org=test-hospital&product=...",
  "organizationId": "9c91d5a8-6dac-49ec-b488-6f803a81ae38",
  "organizationName": "Test Hospital",
  "amount": "$10.00/month",
  "message": "Complete payment to activate your organization"
}
```

### 2. Get User's Organizations
**GET** `/api/organizations/my-organizations`

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Test Hospital",
    "slug": "test-hospital",
    "logo": "...",
    "enabled": false,
    "createdAt": "2025-10-14T...",
    "role": "owner",
    "memberSince": "2025-10-14T..."
  }
]
```

### 3. Polar Webhook Handler
**POST** `/api/webhooks/polar`

Receives webhook events from Polar and automatically:
- Enables the organization when payment is successful
- Updates organization metadata with subscription details
- Sends confirmation email to the owner

## Environment Variables

Required for Polar integration:

```env
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-polar-access-token
POLAR_PRODUCT_ID=your-product-id
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
```

## Testing the Flow

1. **Create an organization** (as admin):
   ```bash
   POST /api/admin/organizations/create
   {
     "name": "Test Hospital",
     "slug": "test-hospital",
     "ownerId": "user-id"
   }
   ```

2. **View dashboard** (as owner):
   - Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - See organization with "Pending Subscription" badge

3. **Click "Subscribe Now"**:
   - Redirects to Polar checkout
   - Complete payment (use test mode in Polar)

4. **Webhook received**:
   - Polar sends webhook to your server
   - Organization is automatically enabled

5. **Verify**:
   - Refresh dashboard
   - Organization now shows "Active" badge
   - Features are now accessible

## Security Notes

- âœ… Only authenticated users can create checkouts
- âœ… Only organization members can subscribe
- âœ… Checkout sessions are unique per organization
- âœ… Webhook signature verification ensures authenticity
- âœ… Organization remains disabled until payment is confirmed

## UI Features

### Status Badges
- ðŸŸ¢ **Active**: Organization is enabled and subscribed
- ðŸŸ¡ **Pending Subscription**: Organization needs payment

### Subscribe Button
- Only visible to organization owners
- Only shown for unpaid organizations
- Disabled during API calls
- Shows loading state during redirect

## Next Steps

After webhook enables the organization:
1. User can create departments
2. User can assign providers
3. Providers can create events
4. Members can book appointments
