# Booking System Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Missing Confirmation Dialog
**Problem:** When a client clicked on an available time slot, the booking was made immediately without confirmation.

**Solution:** Integrated shadcn/ui's AlertDialog component to create a professional, accessible confirmation dialog that shows:
- Provider name and specialization
- Full date format (e.g., "Monday, January 15, 2024")
- Time range and duration
- Service title and description
- Price (if applicable)
- Accessible Cancel and Confirm buttons

The dialog uses the shadcn/ui AlertDialog component, ensuring:
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Proper accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Professional appearance
- Responsive design

The dialog allows users to review their booking details before confirming.

### 2. ‚úÖ Booked Events Disappearing from Provider Calendar
**Problem:** When a client booked an event, it disappeared from the provider's calendar instead of showing as "booked" (red).

**Solution:** Updated the provider calendar to:
- Continue showing booked events (they now appear in RED)
- Display the client's name in the event title: `"Service Name - Booked by Client Name"`
- Keep booked events visible so providers can see their schedule
- Added console logging to help debug event loading

### 3. ‚úÖ Email Notifications Not Working
**Problem:** Booking confirmation emails were not being sent to clients or providers.

**Root Causes:**
1. The "from" email was hardcoded as `"noreply@yourdomain.com"` which is not verified in Resend
2. Insufficient error logging made it hard to diagnose email issues
3. No visibility into whether emails were successfully sent

**Solution:** 
1. Updated to use `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` environment variable (falls back to `"onboarding@resend.dev"` for testing)
2. Added comprehensive logging:
   - Logs when sending emails
   - Logs email response from Resend API
   - Logs detailed error information if email fails
   - Logs Resend configuration status
3. Both client and provider receive email notifications now
4. Booking still succeeds even if email fails (graceful degradation)

## Email Configuration

### Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key

1. Sign up at [Resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Create a new API key in your dashboard
3. Copy the API key

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

In your `apps/server/.env` file, add:

```env
# Resend Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@yourdomain.com
```

### Step 3: Verify Your Domain (Production)

For production use, you need to verify your domain:

1. Go to Resend dashboard
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Add the DNS records provided by Resend
4. Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes)
5. Use an email like `noreply@yourdomain.com` or `bookings@yourdomain.com`

### Step 4: For Testing (Development)

If you're just testing, you can use Resend's test email:

```env
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

**Note:** This will only send to your verified email addresses in Resend dashboard.

## Testing the Booking Flow

### Test as a Client:

1. Log in as a client (e.g., Jones Doe with role USER)
2. Navigate to: Client ‚Üí Organizations ‚Üí Select Organization ‚Üí Select Department ‚Üí Select Provider
3. You'll see the provider's calendar with available time slots (green)
4. Click on an available time slot
5. **NEW:** A confirmation dialog will appear showing all booking details
6. Click "Confirm Booking"
7. You should see a success toast: "Booking confirmed! Check your email for details."
8. Check your email inbox for the confirmation email
9. **FIXED:** The event should now appear on the provider's calendar in RED

### Test as a Provider:

1. Log in as a provider (e.g., John Smith)
2. Go to Provider ‚Üí Calendar
3. You should see:
   - Available slots in GREEN
   - Booked slots in RED with client name: "Service - Booked by Client Name"
4. **FIXED:** Booked events no longer disappear from your calendar
5. Click on a booked event to see booking details
6. Check your email for the booking notification

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?

1. **Check Server Logs:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/server
   pnpm dev
   ```
   
   Look for:
   - `üìß Sending confirmation email to: [email]`
   - `‚úÖ Client email sent successfully`
   - `‚úÖ Provider email sent successfully`

2. **Check for Errors:**
   - `‚ùå Failed to send booking confirmation emails:`
   - `Resend API Key configured: true/false`
   - `Resend From Email: [email]`

3. **Common Issues:**
   - **API Key not set:** Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env`
   - **From email not verified:** Use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing or verify your domain
   - **Email in spam:** Check your spam/junk folder
   - **Rate limits:** Resend has rate limits on free tier

### Events Not Showing on Provider Calendar?

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for: `üìÖ Loaded events for provider: X events`
   - Look for: `Booked events: X`

2. **Verify Event Status:**
   - The event should have `isBooked: true` in the database
   - Provider calendar should show it in red
   - Event title should include client name

### Confirmation Dialog Not Appearing?

1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh the page
3. Try clicking on a different time slot
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Database Query to Check Bookings

If you need to manually check the database:

```sql
-- Check all bookings
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.createdAt,
  e.title,
  e.start,
  e.isBooked,
  u.name as client_name,
  u.email as client_email
FROM Booking b
JOIN Event e ON b.eventId = e.id
JOIN User u ON b.memberId = u.id
ORDER BY e.start DESC;
```
