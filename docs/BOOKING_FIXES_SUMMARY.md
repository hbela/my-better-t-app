# Booking System Fixes - Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with the booking system where events were disappearing, emails were not being sent, and users had no confirmation dialog before booking.

---

## üéØ Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Added Booking Confirmation Dialog (shadcn AlertDialog)
**File:** `apps/web/src/routes/client/organizations/$orgId/departments/$deptId/providers/$providerId.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added state management for confirmation dialog
- Integrated shadcn's `AlertDialog` component for professional confirmation UI
- Dialog displays comprehensive booking details:
  - Provider information with specialization
  - Date in full format
  - Time range and duration
  - Service details (title, description, price if applicable)
  - Accessible Cancel and Confirm buttons
- Users must now confirm before booking (prevents accidental bookings)

**Technology:** Uses shadcn/ui's AlertDialog component for consistent, accessible UI

**Before:** Clicking event immediately created booking
**After:** Shows professional confirmation dialog with all details first

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Provider Calendar - Booked Events Now Visible
**File:** `apps/web/src/routes/provider/calendar.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated `loadEvents()` function to display booked events properly
- Booked events now show client name in title: `"Service - Booked by [Client Name]"`
- Added console logging for debugging
- Events maintain their RED color styling when booked

**Before:** Booked events disappeared from provider's view
**After:** Provider sees all events (green=available, red=booked with client name)

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Fixed Email Notifications
**File:** `apps/server/src/index.ts`

**Changes:**
- Fixed "from" email to use `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` environment variable
- Added comprehensive logging:
  ```javascript
  console.log("üìß Sending confirmation email to:", user.email);
  console.log("‚úÖ Client email sent successfully");
  console.log("‚úÖ Provider email sent successfully");
  ```
- Enhanced error logging with configuration status
- Both client and provider receive emails now
- Graceful degradation (booking succeeds even if email fails)

**Before:** Emails not sent (hardcoded unverified email)
**After:** Proper email delivery with detailed logging

---

## üìã Required Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add to `apps/server/.env`:

```env
# Resend API Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev  # For testing
# OR
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com  # For production (domain must be verified)
```

### Email Setup Steps:

1. **Get Resend API Key:**
   - Visit https://resend.com
   - Sign up / Log in
   - Create API key
   - Copy to `.env` file

2. **For Testing (Quick Start):**
   - Use `onboarding@resend.dev` as from address
   - Emails only sent to verified addresses in your Resend account

3. **For Production:**
   - Add and verify your domain in Resend
   - Update DNS records
   - Use email like `noreply@yourdomain.com`

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Test Booking Flow:

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd apps/server
   pnpm dev

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd apps/web
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **As Client (Jones Doe):**
   - Navigate: Client ‚Üí Organizations ‚Üí Department ‚Üí Provider
   - Click on green time slot
   - **NEW:** Confirmation dialog appears
   - Review details
   - Click "Confirm Booking"
   - Success toast appears
   - Check email for confirmation

3. **As Provider (John Smith):**
   - Navigate: Provider ‚Üí Calendar
   - **FIXED:** See booked events in RED
   - Event shows: "Service - Booked by Jones Doe"
   - Check email for booking notification

### Verify in Server Logs:

Look for these messages:
```
üìß Sending confirmation email to: client@example.com
üìß From email: onboarding@resend.dev
‚úÖ Client email sent successfully: { id: '...' }
üìß Sending provider notification to: provider@example.com
‚úÖ Provider email sent successfully: { id: '...' }
‚úÖ Both booking confirmation emails sent successfully
```

### Check Provider Calendar Console:

Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
üìÖ Loaded events for provider: 5 events
Booked events: 2
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: Emails not received

**Check:**
1. Server logs show email errors?
   - `‚ùå Failed to send booking confirmation emails`
2. API key set in `.env`?
3. Using verified email address?
4. Check spam folder?

**Solution:**
- Start with `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing
- Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Review server logs for detailed error messages

### Problem: Events still disappearing from provider calendar

**Check:**
1. Browser console: `üìÖ Loaded events for provider: X events`
2. Database: `SELECT * FROM Event WHERE isBooked = 1`
3. Clear browser cache
4. Refresh page

**Solution:**
- Events should show in RED when booked
- Check `event.isBooked` is `true` in database
- Verify provider is viewing correct calendar

### Problem: Confirmation dialog not showing

**Check:**
1. Browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Clear browser cache
3. Refresh page

**Solution:**
- Dialog component is rendered when clicking available slot
- Only shows for non-booked events (green slots)
