## 🔧 Configuration

### Email Setup
Update in `apps/server/src/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Line ~2011 and ~2039
from: "noreply@yourdomain.com"  // Change to your verified domain
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in `apps/server/.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:C:/sqlite/db/express.db"
RESEND_API_KEY="your-api-key"
CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3001"
```

## 📝 Notes

### Provider Event Creation
When providers create events, the system now automatically sets:
- `startTime` and `endTime` (for booking display)
- `duration` (calculated in minutes)
- `start` and `end` (for calendar display)
- `price` (optional, null by default)

### Event States
- **Green (Available)**: Can be booked by clients
- **Red (Booked)**: Already booked, not visible to clients
- Providers see both, clients only see green (available)

### Email Behavior
- If email sending fails, the booking still succeeds
- Error is logged but doesn't affect the booking process
- This ensures bookings aren't lost due to email service issues

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: No organizations showing
**Solution**: Admin needs to enable organizations in the admin panel

### Problem: No time slots available
**Solution**: Provider needs to create availability in their calendar

### Problem: "This time slot is no longer available"
**Solution**: Another client booked it first. Refresh and choose a different slot.

### Problem: Email not received
**Solution**: 
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
3. Check server logs for email errors
4. Verify domain is verified with Resend

### Problem: Booking button doesn't work
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure user is authenticated
3. Verify API server is running
4. Check network tab for failed requests

## 🎉 Success!

- Browse service providers
- View available time slots  
- Book appointments with one click
